### Hello, in this repository you will find a folder called 'SurfsUp' inside which has:

- **'Climate_analysis.ipynb** - the analysis undertaken on the climate data
- **'app.py'** - the code for the climate app
- The folder **'Resources'** contains the data files used for this project.

Thanks


Kim
